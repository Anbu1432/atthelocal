## How to install each of the packages

### Angular 17.3.0

#### Prerequisites: node and npm

- Step 1 :- Install Angular CLI Globally
    - The Angular CLI is a command-line tool that simplifies creating, developing, and maintaining Angular projects. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

        ```
        npm install -g @angular/cli
        ```

- Step 2 :- Verify Installation
    -  You can verify the installation by running this command:

        ```
        ng version
        ```

## How to run the project

- Step 1 :- Open the integrated terminal in Vs Code
    - Go to the Terminal tab at the bottom of VS Code.
- Step 2 :- Run the development server
    - Since your project is already open in VS Code, you likely won't need to navigate to the project directory using cd.
    - In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
        
        ```
        ng serve
        ```
    - This will start the Angular development server, compiling your application and serving it on the default port (usually http://localhost:4200).
- Step 3 :- View your application
    - Open http://localhost:4200 (or the port you specified) in your web browser to see your running Angular application.
