## How to run the project

- Step 1 :- Open the integrated terminal in Vs Code
    - Go to the Terminal tab at the bottom of VS Code.
- Step 2 :- Run the project
    - Since your project is already open in VS Code, you likely won't need to navigate to the project directory using cd.
    - In the terminal, identify the entry point of your Node.js project (often index.js, app.js, or server.js).
    - Type the following command and press Enter to execute the script:
    
         ```
        node <entry_point_file>
        ```

    - Replace <entry_point_file> with the actual filename of your project's entry point.
    - The output or behavior of your project will depend on its specific functionality.
